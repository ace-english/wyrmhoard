First, make campaign
	- auto generate
	- iterate loot
	- Hire heroes to clear out enemy dungeons
		- different classes, random characters, different strengths and weaknesses
		- preview/teaser for dungeon

Gameplay loop:
	raid dungeon
	get money
	use money to build base
		base has training and where you live but also dungeon shit
	spend rewards from raid and base on upgrade
	repeat

Then, dungeon designer
	-share programs
	- challenges mean gold when a hero hits them?
		- want to encourage dungeon designs that are fun, challenging, doable. Rating system. Cash per play not per failure - but how to avoid make boring easy maps?
	- reward is proportionate to all the features. Decorations = a little more loot. Player does not lose loot when their dungeon is completed
	Is it for players or bots? The joy of building a killbox - but it needs to be possible
