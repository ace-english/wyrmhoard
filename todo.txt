First, make campaign
	- auto generate
	- iterate loot
	- hack n slash? point and click and turn based?
	- level up and learn moves
		- classeS? skill tree?

Then, dungeon designer
	-share programs
	- challenges mean gold when a hero hits them?
		- want to encourage dungeon designs that are fun, challenging, doable. Rating system. Cash per play not per failure - but how to avoid make boring easy maps?
	- reward is proportionate to all the features. Decorations = a little more loot. Player does not lose loot when their dungeon is completed
